## Deployment Strategy for AdyaTribe

### **Web Components to Deploy:**
1. **Landing Page**: Marketing site for user acquisition
2. **Admin Dashboard**: Community management interface
3. **Documentation**: User guides and community guidelines
4. **API Routes**: Serverless functions for backend logic

### **Environment Setup:**

# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Initialize project
vercel init

# Deploy to staging
vercel --prod=false

# Deploy to production  
vercel --prod
```

## Configuration Best Practices

### **vercel.json Configuration:**
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "functions": {
    "app/api/**/*.js": {
      "runtime": "nodejs18.x"
    }
  },
  "env": {
    "NODE_ENV": "production"
  },
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "CUSTOM_KEY": "@custom-key"
    }
  }
}
```

### **Environment Variables:**
- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection (if needed)
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Payment processing

- **Image Optimization**: Use Vercel's built-in image optimization
- **Caching Strategy**: Configure proper caching headers
- **Code Splitting**: Implement dynamic imports for better performance
- **Serverless Functions**: Keep functions lightweight and fast

## Monitoring & Analytics
- **Deployment Logs**: Monitor build and runtime logs
- **Performance Metrics**: Track Core Web Vitals
- **Error Tracking**: Set up error monitoring
- **Usage Analytics**: Monitor traffic and user behavior

## Common Deployment Patterns

### **Static Site Deployment:**
```bash
# Build static assets
npm run build

# Deploy static site
vercel --prod
```

### **Serverless API Deployment:**
```javascript
// api/users.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  // API logic here
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Success' });
}
```

### **Environment-Specific Configs:**
- **Development**: Local development with hot reload
- **Preview**: Branch deployments for testing
- **Production**: Optimized builds with CDN caching

## Security Considerations
- **Environment Variables**: Never commit secrets to code
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Always use SSL in production
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect APIs from abuse
- **Content Security Policy**: Prevent XSS attacks

## Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Build process runs successfully
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Custom domain connected (if applicable)
- [ ] SSL certificate active
- [ ] Performance metrics acceptable
- [ ] Error monitoring configured
- [ ] Backup and rollback strategy tested

Remember: Reliable deployment is crucial for user trust. Always test thoroughly before production and maintain monitoring for quick issue detection!
