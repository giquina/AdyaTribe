## üöß **Risk Management**

### **Technical Risks:**

**High Risk:**
- **Camera permissions complexity** (Steps 4-5)
  - *Mitigation:* Research Expo Camera early, create prototype
- **Firebase configuration learning curve**
  - *Mitigation:* Start with simple auth, expand gradually

**Medium Risk:**
- **Real-time chat implementation**
  - *Mitigation:* Use Firebase's real-time features, follow tutorials
- **Payment integration complexity**
  - *Mitigation:* Use Stripe's React Native SDK, start simple

**Low Risk:**
- **Design consistency**
  - *Mitigation:* Strong design system already in place

### **Timeline Risks:**

**Scope Creep Prevention:**
- Focus on MVP features only
- Document "nice to have" features for v2
- Weekly scope review with clear priorities

**Learning Curve Management:**
- Allocate extra time for new technologies
- Break complex features into smaller parts
- Seek help early when stuck

## üìä **Progress Tracking**
